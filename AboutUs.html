            <h2>About The Medieval Theme Park</h2>
            <p>
                This theme park was designed for the people who loved Medieval, and was to experience some of that for themselves.
                <br>
                We offer a thematic local built to feel like the world of Medieval Europe everywhere you look.
                <br>
                There's a collection of rides based on fantastic moments within the age of Medieval, fictional or non-fictional, and lives shows of some of those fan favourites.
            </p>
